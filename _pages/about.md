I am a junior student majoring in Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, but I am also interested in Computer Science, especially in the area of Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

At the moment, I am studying at the University of Pennsylvania as an exchange student. Also, I am taking Prof. Jianbo Shi's graduate level course of Vision Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Currently, I am seeking for oppotunities of research intern for the summer of 2018. Please take a look at my CV and if you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me.
