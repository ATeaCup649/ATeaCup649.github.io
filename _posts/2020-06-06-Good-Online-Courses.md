* (Traditional) Computer Vision and Robotics. [Robotics: Vision Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/robotics-vision-intelligence-and-machine-learning)

  I really liked some of the traditional techniques, especially for Image Carving and Image Morphing, but it barely covered any modern CV techniques (CNNs), and the math was pretty straight forward. The projects were written in Matlab.

* (Modern) Computer Vision and Deep Learning. [CIS 680: Vision & Learning](https://fling.seas.upenn.edu/~cis680/wiki/index.php?title=Lectures) (Not Available Anymore)

  I studied the slides and completed the assignments (only 4) by myself in 2018. It was not easy to self-study because it required basic Pytorch knowledge and it took me a long time to start basic training. But the topics covered most of the hot topics in computer vision.
  
* Deep Reinforcement Learning. [CS285: Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)
