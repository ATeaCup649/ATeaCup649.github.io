In this post, we talk about fraudulent charges and how to deal with them.

The first time I had spotted fraudulent charges was only three weeks after I opened the account, which was quite unexpected because I didn't lose my card or authorize anyone to use it. I was still trying hard to get my welcome offer when I discovered some weird pending transactions posted to my account.

I immediately gave Amex a call and a robot assistant asked me to describe the situation, I said I wanted to dispute some recent charges, but she mentioned that pending transactions could not be disputed until they were posted and hung up the phone. I googled online what the differences were between fraudulent charges and disputed charges and found out I actually should have mentioned fraud. So I called again and this time, a human officer joined the line immediately after I said the phrase "Fraudulent Charges". 

I briefly explained the situation and especially emphasized that I had never used the above website. She confirmed my identity and then helped me to terminate those pending transactions. She also changed my card number and asked me to request a new card. She then re-directed my call to some other people at the card center. After a somewhat complicated process, they asked me to apply for a new card on their website because they couldn't send me a confirmation email (which was a little strange) and they promised those suspicious transactions would be removed from my transaction history in 3-5 days.

After about a week, I received my new card and those transactions disappeared. What a relief!

To conclude, if you find anything strange on your transaction history, give your bank a call immediately and they will help you. There is no need to worry. :)
