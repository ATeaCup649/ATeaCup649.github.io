In this post, we talk about how to use [ClustrMaps](https://clustrmaps.com/) to decorate your github pages.

[ClustrMaps](https://clustrmaps.com/) is a website that can track your website visitors from all over the world and visualize it using a real-time map. It is super easy to use and very informative if you are curious about who your visitors are. See [this site](williamlwj.github.io/About) for an example of using ClustrMaps.
