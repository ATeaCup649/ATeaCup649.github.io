# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> About me #
I am a first year Ph.D. student majoring in Statistics at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Guang Cheng](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~chengg/).

Before coming to Purdue, I graduated from the Mathematics department at [Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), with double stream in Computational Applied Mathematics (CAM) and Enrichment Mathematics. My academic advisor was [Prof. Ronald Lok Ming Lui](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~lmlui/). I was also an exchange student at [University of Pennsylvania](https://home.www.upenn.edu/) for one semester in 2018. I had a wonderful summer at Sensetime advised by [Prof. Ping Luo](https://luoping.me)

My research interest lies in the area of Machine Learning, more precisely, in theories of optimization, generative models, and sparsification in deep learning. I am also broadly interested in other Mathematics-related topics.
