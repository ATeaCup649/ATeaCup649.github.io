In this post, we talk about fraudulent charges and how to deal with them.

The first time I've spotted fraudulent charges was only three weeks after I opened the account, which was quite unexpected because I didn't lose my card, neither did I authorize anyone to use my card. I was still trying hard to get my open-account reward when I discovered some weird pending transactions posted on my account.
