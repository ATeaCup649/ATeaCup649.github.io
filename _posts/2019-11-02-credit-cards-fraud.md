In this post, we talk about fraudulent charges and how to deal with them.

The first time I've spotted fraudulent charges was only three weeks after I opened the account, which was quite unexpected because I didn't lose my card, neither did I authorize anyone to use my card. I was still trying hard to get my open-account reward when I discovered some weird pending transactions posted on my account.

I immediately gave Amex a call and when the robot assitant asked me to describe the situation for the first time, I said I wanted to dispute some recent charges, but she mentioned that pending transactions could not be disputed until they were posted and hung up the phone. I googled online what the differences were between fraudulent charges and disputed charges and found out I actually should have mentioned fraud. So I called again and this time, some human assitant joined the line immediately after I said the phrase "Fraudulent Charges". 

I briefly described the situation. She confirmed my identity and then helped me to terminate those pending transactions. She also changed my card number and asked me to request a new card.
