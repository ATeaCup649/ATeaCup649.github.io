I am a senior student majoring in Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, with double stream in Computational Applied Mathematics (CAM) and Enrichment, but I am also very interested in Statistics and Data Science.

I am applying for Ph.D. degrees in Statistics and Industrial Engineering.
