My research interest lies in the intersection of Mathematics and Computer Science. I have devoted a large amount of time and energy
to studying algorithms in Machine Learning: how they work and how we should apply them. Also, aritifial intelligence safety is also one of my concerns given that AI is utililzed everywhere nowadays.

Recently, my interest lies in the field of Computer Vision and Robot Intelligence, i.e. object recognition and computer-human interaction. I am currently taking the graduate level Vision Intelligence and Machine Learning course taught by Prof. Jianbo Shi.
