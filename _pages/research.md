My research interest lies in the intersection of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. I have devoted a large amount of time and energy to studying algorithms in Machine Learning: how they work and how we should apply them. Also, aritifial intelligence safety is also one of my concerns given that AI is utililzed everywhere nowadays.

I am generally interested in all kinds of machine learning algorithms and optimization methods. 

Recently, I am also investigating into the field of Computer Vision and Robot Intelligence, i.e. object recognition and computer-human interaction. I am currently taking the graduate level Vision Intelligence and Machine Learning course taught by Prof. Jianbo Shi.
