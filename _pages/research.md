My research interest lies in the intersection of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. I have devoted a large amount of time and energy to studying algorithms in Machine Learning: how they work and how we should apply them.

I am generally interested in all kinds of machine learning algorithms and data-driven problems.
