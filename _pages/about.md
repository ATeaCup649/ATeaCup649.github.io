# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-fw"></i> About me #
I am a third year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), coadvised by [Prof. Jean Honorio](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jhonorio/) and [Prof. Guang Cheng](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~chengg/). Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics at [Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), with double stream in Computational Applied Mathematics (CAM) and Enrichment Mathematics. My academic advisor was [Prof. Ronald Lok Ming Lui](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~lmlui/). I was also an exchange student at [University of Pennsylvania](https://home.www.upenn.edu/).

My research interests include:

* High Dimensional Statistics
* Bandit Theory
* Optimization Theory
* Neural Networks
