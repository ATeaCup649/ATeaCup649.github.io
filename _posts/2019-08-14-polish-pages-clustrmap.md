In this post, we talk about how to use [ClustrMaps](https://clustrmaps.com/) to decorate your github pages.

[ClustrMaps](https://clustrmaps.com/) is a website that can track your website visitors from all over the world and visualize it using a real-time map. It is super easy to use and very informative if you are curious about who your visitors are. See [this site](https://williamlwj.github.io/About) for an example of using ClustrMaps.

After typing in your website, you can choose whether you want a globe widget or a map widget. A globe widget is more active as it spins constantly while the map widget is only a static image. However, you are able to customize the size/color/pageview text of map widgets, but not for globe widgets. I personally prefer map widgets due to the useful customization.
