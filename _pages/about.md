I am a junior student majoring in Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, but I am also interested in Computer Science, especially in the area of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

At the moment, I am studying at the University of Pennsylvania as an exchange student. Also, I am taking Prof. Jianbo Shi's graduate level course Vision and Learning.

Currently, I am an research assistant at the GRASP (General Robotics Automation Sensing & Perception) lab. I will apply for postgraduate degrees in 2019.
