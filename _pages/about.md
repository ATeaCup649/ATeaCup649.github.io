I am a first year Ph.D. student majoring in Statistics at Purdue University.

Before coming to Purdue, I graduated with first honor from the Mathematics department at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, with double stream in Computational Applied Mathematics (CAM) and Enrichment Mathematics. I was also an exchange student at University of Pennsylvania for one semester in 2018. 

My research interest lies in the area of Machine Learning, more precisely, in theories of Deep Learning, Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning. I am also broadly interested in other Mathematics-related topics.

I am very fortunate to have worked with Prof. Ronald Lui, Prof. Paris Perdikaris, Prof. Raymond Chan and Prof. Ping Luo.
