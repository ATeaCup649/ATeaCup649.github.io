# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-fw"></i> About me #
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), where I am fortunate to be coadvised by [Prof. Qifan Song](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~qfsong/) and [Prof. Jean Honorio](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jhonorio/). 
I have obtained an MS degree in Computer Science and Statistics during my Ph.D. study. 
I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics from [Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), with double stream in Computational Applied Mathematics (CAM) and Enrichment Mathematics. 
My academic advisor was [Prof. Ronald Lok Ming Lui](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~lmlui/). I was also an exchange student at [University of Pennsylvania](https://home.www.upenn.edu/). I was an intern at [Amazon Ads](https://advertising.amazon.com/) and [Sensetime Research](https://www.sensetime.com/en).

My research interests include:

* Optimization Theory
* Bandit Algorithms
* Federated Learning
* High Dimensional Statistics
* Deep Learning Theory and Practice

I am actively building and maintaining an open-source Python library for *X*-armed bandit algorithms and benchmarks. Check out [this repository](https://github.com/WilliamLwj/PyXAB).
